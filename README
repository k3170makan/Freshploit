A simple python script that brings the vulnerability reports (from 1337day) right to your command line

Installation:
All you need to do is make sure you have the dependencies installed, and then simply run the script

Advice:
This script is most effective when run from your .bashrc file ;)

Further Development:
I plan to combined results from exploit-db , vulnerability-lab and other such vulnerability reporting site soon
